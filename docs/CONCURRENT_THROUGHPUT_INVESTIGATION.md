# Concurrent Throughput Investigation: Batch Size Analysis

**Date**: March 10, 2026
**Task**: Investigate 0.50x concurrent throughput gap (0.83x sequential)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Key finding: NOT a batch size limit issue

---

## Executive Summary

**Result**: INCREASING `max_batch_size` does NOT improve concurrent throughput. In fact, `max_batch=4` performs BEST at concurrency=4 (69.9 tok/s vs 67.1 tok/s for max_batch=32).

**Key Finding**: The bottleneck is NOT the scheduler batch size limit. Follow-up tracing on March 11, 2026 shows the decode queue can form multi-request cohorts, but those cohorts are then executed as closed groups to completion, so later decode-ready requests cannot merge into the live loop.

---

## Hypothesis

**Original Hypothesis**: The default `max_batch_size=4` in `config/server.yaml` limits concurrent throughput because the scheduler can only process 4 requests at a time.

**Investigation**: Test different `max_batch_size` values (4, 8, 16, 32) at different concurrency levels (1, 2, 4) to measure impact on throughput and batch size utilization.

---

## Test Configuration

**Hardware**: NVIDIA RTX 4000 Ada (20GB VRAM)
**Model**: Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct Q4_K_M
**Test**: 16 requests, 64 tokens each, temperature=0
**Metrics**: Collected via Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint after each run

## Results

### Throughput Comparison (tok/s)

| max_batch_size | c=1 | c=2 | c=4 |
|----------------|-----|-----|-----|
| **4**  | 59.7 | **68.3** | **69.9** |
| 8   | 61.9 | 65.7 | 66.8 |
| 16  | 61.8 | 67.1 | 69.5 |
| 32  | 60.8 | 63.8 | 67.1 |

### Batch Size Distribution at c=4

**max_batch=4** (best performer at 69.9 tok/s):
- Max batch observed: 3
- Bucket 1 (single-sequence): 681 passes (89.4%)
- Bucket 2 (2 sequences): 24 passes (3.2%)
- Bucket 3-4 (3-4 sequences): 38 passes (5.0%)
- Total decode passes: 743

**max_batch=16** (close second at 69.5 tok/s):
- Max batch observed: 4
- Bucket 1 (single-sequence): 580 passes (86.3%)
- Bucket 2 (2 sequences): 57 passes (8.5%)
- Bucket 3-4 (3-4 sequences): 42 passes (6.3%)
- Total decode passes: 679

### Scaling Efficiency

| max_batch_size | c=4 speedup | Efficiency |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| **4**  | 1.17x | 29% |
| 8   | 1.08x | 27% |
| 16  | 1.12x | 28% |
| 32  | 1.10x | 28% |

**Ideal scaling**: 4x concurrency = 4x speedup (400% efficiency)
**Actual scaling**: ~1.1x speedup (~28% efficiency)
**Gap**: 3.6x throughput missing

## Analysis

### Finding 1: Batch Size Limit is NOT the Bottleneck

**Evidence**: Increasing `max_batch_size` from 4 to 32 DECREASES throughput by 4% (69.9 → 67.1 tok/s).

**Conclusion**: The default `max_batch_size=4` is NOT limiting concurrent throughput. The bottleneck lies elsewhere.

### Finding 2: Scheduler Fails to Batch Concurrent Requests

**Evidence**: At c=4 with max_batch=4:
- 89.4% of decode passes are single-sequence (bucket 1)
- Only 5% of passes use batches of 3-4 sequences
- This means 4 concurrent requests are mostly processed as 4 separate single-sequence batches

**Implication**: The scheduler's continuous batching logic is not effectively grouping concurrent requests into larger batches.

### March 11 Follow-up: decode workers do form cohorts, but they stay isolated

Privileged benchmark runs with the new `inferflux_scheduler_decode_worker_batch_size_total`
metric show the queue is not purely starving:

- `decode_pool_size=2`: worker batches were `4:1`, `3:1`, `2:1`, `1:3`
- `decode_pool_size=1`: worker batches were `4:2`, `2:1`, `1:2`

Yet native decode forward passes still skew heavily small:

- `decode_pool_size=2`: decode forward buckets `1:147`, `2:6`, `3_4:33`
- `decode_pool_size=1`: decode forward buckets `1:89`, `2:31`, `3_4:35`

This narrows the root cause: the queue can hand off multi-request work, but
`ExecuteUnifiedBatchPhased()` keeps each selected cohort closed until its decode
slice completes. New decode-ready requests wait for a later scheduler pass
instead of joining the active batch, which fragments continuous batching.

### March 11 Follow-up 2: persistent decode working set removes most queue churn

The first scheduler refactor changed decode workers to keep unfinished requests
in a local working set instead of requeueing every token through
`pending_decode_`. On the same short `concurrency=4` Qwen2.5-3B Q4_K_M probe:

- Native throughput improved from `101.7 tok/s` to `117.4 tok/s`
- Exact match stayed `8/10`
- Scheduler decode-worker executed batch sizes became:
  - `1:94`
  - `2:32`
  - `3:34`
- Native decode forward batch sizes became:
  - `1:94`
  - `2:32`
  - `3_4:34`

This is the strongest scheduler-side signal so far: once queue churn is
removed, the decode-worker cohort size and the native forward batch size line
up almost exactly. That means the remaining throughput gap is no longer caused
primarily by scheduler admission fragmentation on the safe path.

### March 11 Follow-up 3: preserving bound decode routing removes redundant work, but not the remaining throughput gap

The next safe slice stopped `ResolveBackends()` from re-routing requests that
were already in decode with a live sequence slot and bound backend. That
preserves correct request affinity and removes redundant per-step routing work,
but the short live probe did **not** produce a meaningful throughput win:

- Native throughput: `110.6 tok/s`
- `cuda_llama_cpp`: `153.0 tok/s`
- Exact match: `6/8`

Most importantly, the new scheduler metric still matched the native forward
histogram exactly:

- Scheduler decode-worker executed batch sizes:
  - `1:105`
  - `2:57`
  - `3:2`
- Native decode forward batch sizes:
  - `1:105`
  - `2:57`
  - `3_4:2`

This confirms the remaining gap is not coming from decode-worker re-routing or
queue admission drift. The next optimization pass should focus on native
executor/backend hot-path cost, not more scheduler routing changes.

### March 11 Follow-up 4: direct stepwise fast path was exercised end-to-end and still did not unlock throughput

The next scheduler slice added a direct decode-worker fast path for sticky local
working sets. When every request in the active decode lane was already bound to
the same backend with valid step state, the worker skipped rebuilding
`RequestBatch`, `overrides`, and `exec_pending`.

The short privileged probe showed that this fast path dominated execution:

- `inferflux_scheduler_decode_worker_execution_path_total{path="direct_stepwise"} = 178`
- no `general` decode-worker path executions were recorded
- scheduler decode-worker batch sizes still matched native decode forward batch
  sizes exactly

Yet throughput remained behind:

- Native throughput: `101.7 tok/s`
- `cuda_llama_cpp`: `131.0 tok/s`
- Exact match: `6/8`

That closes the scheduler-side investigation for this path. The remaining gap is
now attributable to native backend/operator cost, not decode-worker scaffolding.

### March 11 Follow-up 5: exact-shape Q4_K down-proj hot kernels close most of the remaining gap

Backend-side benchmarking changed the picture. The isolated native benchmark for
the exact decode down-proj shape (`N=2048`, `K=11008`) showed:

- `Q4_K M=1`: `1.104x` speedup for `q8_1_gemv_hot_fixed`
- `Q4_K M=2`: `1.160x` speedup for `q8_1_gemv_row_pair_hot_fixed`
- `Q6_K` regressions in the same envelopes

That justified a narrow promotion: enable the exact-shape `Q4_K` hot kernels by
default while keeping `Q6_K` behind the existing experimental env gates.

The end-to-end short probe with those kernels enabled moved native much closer
to `cuda_llama_cpp` without additional accuracy drift:

- Native throughput: `121.4 tok/s`
- `cuda_llama_cpp`: `129.1 tok/s`
- Exact match: `6/8`
- Native/llama throughput ratio: `0.94x`

This is the first backend-side change in the current pass that materially
improves the native gap. The next optimization target remains decode FFN/down-
proj, but it should now focus on the still-dominant grouped FFN path rather
than more scheduler work.

### Finding 3: Lower Batch Count is Correlated with Higher Throughput

**Observation**: max_batch=16 has 679 decode passes vs 743 for max_batch=4, but similar throughput.

**Hypothesis**: Fewer, larger batches may be more efficient than many smaller batches, even if most batches are single-sequence.

---

## Root Cause Hypothesis

### Primary Suspect: Request Scheduling Latency

**Theory**: The scheduler processes requests serially via `BuildBatchLocked()`, with each batch processed completely before the next batch is built. This creates a pipeline:

1. Build batch (single-sequence for request A)
2. Execute batch (request A decode step)
3. Write response
4. Repeat for request B

**Result**: Even though requests are concurrent, they're processed sequentially in single-sequence batches.

**Evidence**:
- 89% single-sequence batches at c=4
- Low scaling efficiency (29% of ideal 4x)
- Increasing max_batch doesn't help (scheduler still builds single-sequence batches)

### Secondary Suspects

1. **Token budget limit**: `max_batch_tokens=16384` may be hit, preventing larger batches
   - **Test**: Increase to 32768 and measure

2. **Batch accumulation timeout**: `batch_accumulation_ms=0` means no waiting for larger batches
   - **Test**: Set to 2-5ms to allow batch building

3. **Scheduler mutex contention**: `BuildBatchLocked()` holds global lock during batch building
   - **Test**: Profile lock wait times with instrumentation

4. **GPU kernel limitations**: Batched decode kernels may not be faster than single-sequence
   - **Test**: Profile kernel execution time for B=1 vs B=4

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Investigation

1. **Profile scheduler behavior**:
   - Add timing instrumentation around `BuildBatchLocked()`
   - Measure time between batch builds
   - Track why requests aren't being batched (token budget? timing? priority?)

2. **Test batch accumulation delay**:
   - Set `batch_accumulation_ms=2` to allow scheduler to wait for larger batches
   - Measure impact on throughput and latency

3. **Increase token budget**:
   - Set `max_batch_tokens=32768` from 16384
   - Measure if token budget is preventing batching

### If Scheduling is Bottleneck

4. **Decode worker optimization**:
   - Check if `use_decode_workers_` is enabled
   - Profile decode worker thread behavior
   - May need separate decode worker thread pool

5. **Batch building policy**:
   - Current: `priority_age` (oldest high-priority first)
   - Try: `throughput_balanced` or `lpm_priority`
   - May improve batching behavior

### If GPU Kernels are Bottleneck

6. **Profile batched kernel efficiency**:
   - Use Nsight Compute to measure B=1 vs B=4 kernel performance
   - Check if memory bandwidth is saturated
   - May need kernel optimization for larger batches

---

## Recommendations

### DO NOT Change Default max_batch_size

**Reason**: Testing shows max_batch=4 performs BEST at c=4. Increasing to 16 or 32 reduces throughput.

### DO Investigate Scheduler Behavior

**Priority**: HIGH - This is the most likely bottleneck

**Approach**:
1. Add instrumentation to measure batch building frequency
2. Profile why single-sequence batches dominate
3. Test batch_accumulation_ms and token budget changes

### DO Profile GPU Resource Utilization

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Rule out GPU kernel limitations

**Approach**:
1. Use Nsight Systems to trace execution
2. Measure SM utilization during concurrent requests
3. Check if memory bandwidth is saturated

---

## Conclusion

The concurrent throughput gap (0.50x at c=4) is NOT caused by the `max_batch_size` limit. The scheduler predominantly processes single-sequence batches even when multiple requests are concurrent, indicating a scheduling or execution bottleneck rather than a configuration limit.

**Next action**: Profile scheduler behavior to understand why requests aren't being batched effectively.

## Update: Batch Accumulation Test

**Date**: March 10, 2026 (later)
**Test**: Measured impact of `batch_accumulation_ms` on throughput

**Results**:
| accum_ms | Tok/s | B=1% | B=2% | B=3-4% | Decodes |
|----------|-------|------|------|--------|--------|
| 0 | 71.7 | 70.4 | 22.5 | 7.0 | 142 |
| **2** | **74.7** | 61.4 | 38.6 | 0.0 | 140 |

**Finding**: `batch_accumulation_ms=2` improves throughput by 4.2%, but this is far from the 100% improvement needed to close the concurrent throughput gap.

**Recommendation**: Set `batch_accumulation_ms=2` in default config for modest improvement, but continue investigating the primary bottleneck (likely GPU kernel efficiency or decode loop architecture).
