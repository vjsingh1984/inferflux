```

## 1) Product Contract

| Pillar | Concrete meaning |
|---|---|
| API compatibility | Core request/admin surfaces remain OpenAI-style and scriptable |
| Operator control plane | Auth, policy, routing, audit, metrics, and admin APIs are part of the product, not sidecars |
| Dual CUDA strategy | `native_cuda` is the headroom path; `cuda_llama_cpp` is the compatibility/safety path |
| Memory economy | Shared weights, separate KV lifecycle, prefix reuse, and explicit memory policy knobs |
| Stateless default | Baseline API stays stateless; `session_id` reuse is optional and bounded |
| Honest scale path | Single-node rigor first, distributed claims only when lifecycle and failure contracts exist |

## 2) Current Reality

| State | Code-aligned reading |
|---|---|
| Strong today | API/admin/CLI contracts, backend/provider identity, policy-visible fallback, prefix/KV reuse, admin pools visibility, and operator observability |
| Foundation now | Native loader detection, memory-first GGUF dequant policy, KV auto-tune planning/metrics, optional session leases, distributed ticket lifecycle, timeout debt, and optional fail-closed generation admission |
| Still not leadership | Quantized native GGUF throughput, graph-captured decode/prefill envelopes, native-owned endpoint independence everywhere, deterministic distributed ownership cleanup, mandatory GPU release lane |

## 3) Modern Serving Posture

| Modern practice | InferFlux reading today | What still has to close |
|---|---|---|
| Sync batching over naive async fragmentation | Adopted | Only re-enable native async if it preserves the same batched execution core |
| Quantized serving as first-class runtime path | Adopted foundation | Finish fused GGUF hot paths so memory-first mode is also the fast path |
| Paged KV plus budget-aware planning | Adopted foundation | Mature allocator/ownership behavior under concurrency |
| PD disaggregation with transport health | Adopted foundation | Close sequence ownership, cleanup, and multi-process fault matrix |
| Explicit provider/fallback identity | Adopted | Keep every API/CLI/admin surface aligned as backends evolve |
| Contract gates before grade moves | Adopted stance | Add required GPU/provider lanes before claiming release-grade runtime maturity |

## 4) Old Practices to Retire

| Retire | Replace with |
|---|---|
| Hidden compatibility fallback | Explicit backend/provider/fallback metadata and policy decisions |
| “Async means faster” | Measure batch quality, hot-path residency, and end-to-end throughput |
| Persistent dequant buffers by default | Policy-scoped dequant with memory-first `none` as the native GGUF default |
| Fixed KV reservations | Budgeted KV planning with exported decisions |
| Passive readiness only | Readiness plus optional fail-closed admission where degraded transport should stop new generation work |
| Benchmark-only product claims | Contract tests plus representative runtime evidence |

## 5) Grade Stance

| Area | Reading |
|---|---|
| Overall | `B-` |
| Why not lower | Control-plane, identity, observability, and memory-policy foundations are real and tested |
| Why not higher | Native throughput and distributed ownership semantics are not yet best-in-class or release-enforced |
